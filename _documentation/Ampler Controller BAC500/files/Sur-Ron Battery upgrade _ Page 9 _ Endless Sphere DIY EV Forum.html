I did find the dimensions and weight specs on the ASI site as a small pdf.

These controllers are well regarded, but the more i read up on the
complexity of the entire process i don't think they're for me at this
time...

Hello. I saw in the late 2021 messages that there was no bbshd harness
in stock. Did that change? Could it change in the near future? I am
interested.

What you need is a JST PADP-24V-1-S connector. JST is the manufacturer.
If you do a web search for that part it will perhaps lead you to a
supplier.

Did you buy a controller for $50 online and need a connector and
programming information? I am considering buying one, but the company
protects the configuration software apparently.

Yes I bought a bunch since the price was so good, they are $750 online

I did search that part# obviously but I was unable to find a place to
buy them? If you know a link please send it here!

Does anyone have a contact at ASI to get these 24 pin harnesses? These
controllers look sweet and they are tiny! But they are useless right now

edit~ and from what ive read you can use the software in the Phaserunner
thread to get it working, and this pic above shows pins for usb to ttl
to program it, just sourcing the harness is the issue I think

Here you can buy the female Plug.
Im searching too for the connectors... I did buy 2 asibac 500 too😁.
But don't know which pins I need for cable to plug in
I found two but don't know.
You get everything on Aliexpress.
I think the 2 different crimp connector are for different thick cables.
A Datasheet for this female plug I found on this Site. (scroll down (PDF).)

Oh geez that seems like alot of tiny little finger work, not sure making
that harness will be so fun...
Someone want to make 100x of them can have a good little business!

Thank you very much for the links! Looks like everything has to come
from China

Nice work on sourcing the plugs and pins. Those aren't really a big
thing to assemble...just strip, crimp and click them into place in the
24 pin plug.

It would be helpful to know which pins to use to address the BAC500
controller TX, RX etc. I don't quite feel like putting in the investment
until I know that there is a workaround. It would be good to know if the
open source KT controller software could be made to work on it.

I don't like it when a company holds a secret key to a product I own;
it's as if I don't truly own the product and plus they have a habit of
going out of business or ending the support of a product line that
otherwise still would work.

will the bac8000 work with the zero 75-7 or do you have to convert it to

        There is no motor that I had problems with matching it up with
        controller.

    will the bac8000 work with the zero 75-7 or do you have to convert
    it to hall sensors?
    Click to expand...


It won't. You'll need a hall sensor.

Just compare the description and technical information from the cable I
linked. If they are the same, that should work

I tried of the TTL to USB converters,

rx to rx
tx to tx
gnd to gnd

and set the converter to 5v.

set baud rate to 9100

no dice,

Did I miss anything?

You need to swap the rx and tx pairs?

rx to tx
tx to rx
gnd to gnd

If you did rx-rx tx-tx you may have damaged the controller

I don't want to mislead you, I saw in a screen installation video a
warning not to reverse it since it can damage the controller, but now I
just found this on google:
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/262843/is-it-ok-that-i-
accidentally-swapped-tx-and-rx-on-a-uart-bus
So hopefully it's okay

kgff,
phew, thanks a bunch for finding this stackexchange post, I appreciate
it, very informative.
I will try again this weekend, my bafang connector was mis delivered by
mighty usps to a different address (not getting that one I guess).
I ordered another one off aliexpress, meanwhile I have another usb > TTL
dongle I will test with.
